Haamuur; ma ydkhil wala ykhalli ‘is-semach ydkhiluun

Translation: A hamour; he neither enters nor allows other fish to come in.
Meaning: The Hamour fish lives in the ocean near the Gulf countries. It’s a big fish that likes to hang out near special traps people use to catch smaller fish. The Hamour might be looking for a snack, but it also scares the little fish away from the trap! This way, the Hamour can catch them later for an easy meal.
Nyuum ‘is-sema ‘agreb lek

Translation: The stars in heaven are closer to you
Meaning: This saying is a funny way to tell someone ‘No way!’ when they ask for something impossible. It’s like saying, ‘Forget it! You have a better chance of grabbing a star out of the sky than getting what you want from me!’
Maddaah nafsah ybaalah rafsah

Translation: He who praises himself deserves a kick
Meaning: This saying means that you shouldn’t talk about yourself too much or in a bragging manner. It’s better to let your actions speak for themselves!
Halaat ith-thob rig’itah minnah w fiih

Translation: A dress is beautiful when it is patched using its material
Meaning: This proverb urges someone to marry a relative rather than a stranger. Also, it encourages two business parties to keep their business between them.
